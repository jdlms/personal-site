    <span>🗽🛫🇩🇪</span>
    <p>
      I’m from New England and moved from Brooklyn to Berlin in 2017. I’ve always been a
      highly-curious autodidact who derives joy from learning complex systems. I value creativity,
      pragmatism, and efficiency. I’m highly social, enjoy communicating with others, and love
      reading.
    </p>
    <span>📚📝💼</span>
    <p>
      I have 6 years experience in New York City book publishing, first in editorial, and then at
      two scouting agencies, where I identified books for translation. Since moving to Germany, I
      have worked as an office assistant, a freelance editor, translator, and on the DevOps team of
      a digital music distributor. I currently work for a startup in Potsdam.
    </p>
    <span>👨‍💻🔨📡</span>
    <p>
      I recently completed a 6-month web development bootcamp, where I learned to use HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript, React, Node, Express, Mongo & Mongoose, version control, authentication, and REST.
    </p>
    <p>
      My learning touched on topics such as algorithms, Styled Components, SSR, Typescript, SQL, and
      Docker. I built and deployed several projects, including a full-stack React app using React
      Router, React Query, react-hook-forms, and MUI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most importantly, I learned how to take on challenges and solve problems like a software
      engineer: by reading the docs, searching for answers, and staying curious.
