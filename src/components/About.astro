      I was born in New England and moved from Brooklyn to Berlin in 2017. I’ve always been a
      highly-curious autodidact who derives joy from learning complex systems. I value creativity,
      pragmatism, and efficiency. I enjoy communicating with others and love reading.

      I currently work for an app startup in Potsdam. Since moving to Germany, I have worked as an
      office assistant, a freelance editor, translator, and on the DevOps team of a digital music
      distributor. Prior to relocating, I had a career in New York City book publishing.

      Recently, I completed a 6-month web development bootcamp at Ironhack Berlin, where I gained
      in-depth practical experience with many technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React,
      Node, Express, databases, version control, authentication, HTTP and REST. But, most
      importantly, what I learned was how to take on challenges as a software engineer: by breaking
      big problems down into small parts, reading the docs, and continuously learning.

      I'm currently studying algorithms and relational databases, while continuing to build projects
      in Typescript. My goals for this year (2023) are to grow my portfolio and build a few projects
      in Go by December.
