    <p>
      I’m from northeast coast of the USA and have lived in Germany for +5 years. 🌄 I’ve always
      been a highly-curious autodidact who derives joy from learning complex systems. I value
      creativity, clarity, and pragmatic efficiency. I’m highly social, enjoy communicating with
      others, and am seldom frightened off by new challenges. And I love reading.

      <span> Work experience 📝</span>
      <br /> I have 6 years experience in New York City book publishing, first at Alfred A. Knopf (Random
      House), and then at two scouting agencies, where I identified titles for international publishers
      to translate. Since relocating to Berlin, I have worked as an office assistant, a freelance editor/translator,
      and on the DevOps team of a digital music distributor. I currently work for a startup in Potsdam.

      <span> Where did I study? 📚</span>
      <br /> I recently completed a 6-month web development bootcamp at Ironhack, in a class of six students,
      where the focus was all things JavaScript. I learned to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node,
      Express, Mongo & Mongoose, version control, authentication/authorization, and REST. And our learning
      touched on advanced topics such as algorithms, Styled Components, SSR, Typescript, SQL, and Docker.
      I built and deployed several projects, including a full-stack React app that employed React Router,
      React Query, react-hook-forms, and MUI. Most importantly, I learned how to take on new challenges
      and solve problems like a software engineer: by reading documentation and searching for answers.
