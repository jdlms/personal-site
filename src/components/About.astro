      About me 🌄 <br /> I’m from northeast coast of the USA and have lived in Germany for +5 years.
      I’ve always been a highly-curious autodidact who derives joy from learning complex systems. I value
      creativity, clarity, and pragmatic efficiency. I’m highly social, enjoy communicating with others,
      and am seldom frightened off by new challenges. And I love reading.

      Work experience 📝 <br /> I have 6 years experience in New York City book publishing, first at
      Alfred A. Knopf (Random House), and then at two scouting agencies, where I identified titles for
      international publishers to translate. Since relocating to Berlin, I have worked as an office assistant,
      a freelance editor/translator, and on the DevOps team of a digital music distributor. I currently
      work for a startup in Potsdam.

      Where did I study? 📚 <br /> I recently completed a 6-month web development bootcamp at Ironhack,
      in a class of six students, where the focus was all things JavaScript. I learned to use HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript, React, Node, Express, Mongo & Mongoose, version control, authentication/authorization,
      and REST. And our learning touched on advanced topics such as algorithms, Styled Components, SSR,
      Typescript, SQL, and Docker. I built and deployed several projects, including a full-stack React
      app that employed React Router, React Query, react-hook-forms, and MUI. Most importantly, I learned
      how to take on new challenges and solve problems like a software engineer: by reading documentation
      and searching for answers. 👨‍💻🔨📡
