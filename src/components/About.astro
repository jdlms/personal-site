    <p class="header">
      Born in New England, I moved from Brooklyn to Berlin in 2017. I’ve always been a
      highly-curious autodidact who derives joy from learning complex systems. I value creativity,
      pragmatism, and efficiency. I’m highly social, enjoy communicating with others, and love
      reading.

      I currently work for a navigation app startup in Potsdam. Since moving to Germany, I have
      worked as an office assistant, a freelance editor, translator, and on the DevOps team of a
      digital music distributor. I have 6 years prior experience in book publishing.

      I recently completed a 6-month web development bootcamp, where I learned in-depth many topics
      in depth, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node, Express, Mongo & Mongoose, version
      control, authentication, and REST.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most importantly, I learned how to take on challenges and solve problems like a software
      engineer: by reading the docs, searching for answers, and continuously learning.

      Currently studying algorithms, while practicing using Postgres and Tailwind, my goals for this
      year (2023) are to continue to grow my portfolio and to build at least one project in Go by
      December.
