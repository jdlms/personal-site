    <p class="header">
      I’m from New England and moved from Brooklyn to Berlin in 2017. I’ve always been a
      highly-curious autodidact who derives joy from learning complex systems. I value creativity,
      pragmatism, and efficiency. I’m highly social, enjoy communicating with others, and love
      reading.
    </p>
    <span>📚📝💼</span>
    <p>
      I have 6 years experience in book publishing, first in editorial, and then at two scouting
      agencies, where I identified books for translation. Since moving to Germany, I have worked as
      an office assistant, a freelance editor, translator, and on the DevOps team of a digital music
      distributor. I currently work for a navigation app startup in Potsdam.

    <span>🧑🏽‍💻🔨📡</span>
    <p>
      I recently completed a 6-month web development bootcamp, where I learned in depth  HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript, React, Node, Express, Mongo & Mongoose, version control, authentication, and REST.
    </p>
    <p>
      I built and deployed several projects, including a full-stack React app using React Router,
      React Query, react-hook-forms, and MUI, with an Express backend. Most importantly, I learned
      how to take on challenges and solve problems like a software engineer: by reading the docs,
      searching for answers, and continuously learning.
    </p>
    <span>🏋🏽📅🎯</span>
    <p>
      Currently studying algorithms, while practicing Postgres and deployment with AWS, my goals for
      this year (2023) are to continue to grow my portfolio and to build at least one project in Go
      by December.
