    <span>Hi, I'm Joshua!</span> Iâ€™m a web developer with a
    passion for creative problem-solving and programming. I
    live in Berlin, Germany and this my small digital
    garden, where I post recent projects, track what I've
    been learning, and blog about life and code. ðŸŒ±
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Here's a small list of some things I'm enthusiastic
    about: â—¦ Typescript â—¦ Manipulating web APIs â—¦ Building
    smart with modular and readable project architecture â—¦
    Intuitive and accessible UI/UX â—¦ Experimenting with
    frameworks like as React, Angular, Svelte, and Astro â—¦
    User privacy â—¦ Growing my CI/CD knowledge â—¦ AWS â—¦
    Learning new languages such as Go and Python.
