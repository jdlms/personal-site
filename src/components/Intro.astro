    <span class="font-semibold text-xl md:text-2xl">Hi, I'm Joshua,</span> a web
    developer in Germany who values rapid iteration, creativity, and solving problems
    with code. This my small digital garden, where I bookmark what I've been reading,
    collect my projects, and (eventually) blog. ðŸŒ±

    Here are some things I'm enthusiastic about: leveraging the cloud, modular
    systems architecture, using the platform, balancing tradeoffs, Typescript,
    Go, infrastructure, intuitive and simple UI/UX. When it comes to web
    technology, I'm omnivorous; as comfortable setting styles as configuring
    servers and always learning. I currently work at <span
