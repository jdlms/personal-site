    I currently work on special projects and internal tools
    @<span>Statista Q</span>. I value creativity,
    efficiency, and simplicity. When it comes to web
    technology, I am omnivorous; striving to be as
    comfortable setting styles as configuring servers.

    In 2022, I followed my love of coding and building for
    the web into a 6-month bootcamp at Ironhack Berlin where
    I learned to take on problems like a software engineer:
    by breaking them into small parts, reading the docs, and
    continuously learning.

    While in Berlin I have worked at a motorcyle navigation
    app startup, a digital music distributor, a tax office,
    and as a translator and copy-writer. In a previous life,
    I had a career in New York City book publishing.
