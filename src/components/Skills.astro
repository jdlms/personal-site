    Iâ€™m a curious autodidact who derives joy from systems
    and pragmatic solutions. I value creativity, efficiency,
    frank communication, and simplicity. When it comes to
    web technology, I am omnivorous, as comfortable setting
    styles as configuring servers.

    I currently work on special projects and internal tools
    @Statista Q. In Germany I have worked at a motorcyle
    navigation app startup, a digital music distributor
    startup, in a tax office, and as a translator and
    copy-writer. In a previous life, I had a career in New
    York City book publishing.

    In 2022, I followed my love of code and building for the
    web into a 6-month bootcamp at Ironhack Berlin where I
    learned to take on challenges by breaking large problems
    into small parts, reading the docs, and continuously
    learning.
