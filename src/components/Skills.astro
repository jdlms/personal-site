  <p id="intro">
    I was born in New England and moved from Brooklyn to
    Berlin in 2017. Iâ€™ve always been a highly-curious
    autodidact who derives joy from learning complex
    systems. I value creativity, pragmatism, and efficiency.
    I enjoy communicating with others and love reading.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    I currently work for an app startup in Potsdam. Since
    moving to Germany, I have worked as an office assistant,
    a freelance editor, translator, and on the DevOps team
    of a digital music distributor. Prior to relocating, I
    had a career in New York City book publishing.

    Recently, I completed a 6-month web development bootcamp
    at Ironhack Berlin, where I gained in-depth practical
    experience with many technologies, including HTML, CSS,
    JavaScript, React, Node, Express, databases, version
    control, authentication, HTTP and REST. But, most
    importantly, what I learned was how to take on
    challenges as a software engineer: by breaking big
    problems down into small parts, reading the docs, and
    continuously learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently studying algorithms and relational
    databases, while continuing to build projects in
    Typescript. My goals for this year (2023) are to grow my
    portfolio and build a few projects in Go by December.
