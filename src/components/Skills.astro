    Iâ€™ve always been a highly-curious autodidact who derives
    joy from systems and pragmatic solutions. I value
    creativity, efficiency, frank communication, and
    simplicity. When it comes to web technology, I am
    omnivorous, as comfortable setting styles as configuring
    servers.

    I currently work on special projects and internal tools
    @Statista Q. In Germany I have worked at a motorcyle
    navigation app startup, a digital music distributor
    startup, in a tax office, and as a translator and
    copy-writer. In a previous life, I had a high-paced
    career in New York City book publishing.

    In 2022, I followed my love of code and building for the
    web into a 6-month bootcamp at Ironhack Berlin where I
    learned to take on challenges by breaking large problems
    into small parts, reading the docs, and continuously
    learning.
